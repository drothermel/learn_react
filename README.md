From Next.JS + Firebase Course
- Component Lifecycle
  - `componentDidMount(){}` - initialized
  - `componentDidUpdate(){}` - state updated
  - `componentWillUnmount(){}` - destroyed
- React Hooks
  - Purpose: Expose low level primitives around the state separately from components.
  - Notes
    - Only call them at the top level of a functional component (not in regular js components, loops, nests, etc)
  - `useState(default_state)` - update the state
    - returns an array [reactive_val, setter], eg. `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)`
  - `useEffect(your_fxn)` - impl logic for the lifecycle
